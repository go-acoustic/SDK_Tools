Swift Integration:
———————————————————

Integrating the Swift2 application
Integrate the Swift2 application with the Digital Analytics SDK.
Procedure
1. Create a header file and name it DigitalAnalyticsBridgingHeader.h. 
2. Import DAMod/DigitalAnalytics.h into the header file.
3. Add the newly created DigitalAnalyticsBridgingHeader.h header file to your project settings.
 a. Selecting your project in the XCode left pane.
 b. Clicking Build Settings and find Objective-C Bridging Header. 
 c. Set the value of Objective-C Bridging Header to DigitalAnalyticsBridgingHeader.h. 
4. Rest of the steps about integration of the library files are same as under section “Integrating the SDK into your iOS application” of Chapter 2 “Integrating the SDK into your iOS application” of Digital Analytics User’s Guide
5. Open the app delegate file of your application and locate the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions function and call DigitalAnalytics.startup() from there or from another suitable location.
6. Locate the applicationWillTerminate function and call DigitalAnalytics.shutdown() from applicationWillTerminate or from another suitable location.
7. Call the Digital Analytics fireXXX APIs from any appropriate location after DigitalAnalytics.startup() is called the first time.
